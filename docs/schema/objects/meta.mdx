The type for the top-level \_meta field

```graphql
type _Meta_ {
  block: _Block_!
  deployment: String!
  hasIndexingErrors: Boolean!
}
```

### Fields

#### `block` ([`_Block_!`]

Information about a specific subgraph block. The hash of the block
will be null if the \_meta field has a block constraint that asks for
a block number. It will be filled if the \_meta field has no block constraint
and therefore asks for the latest block

#### `deployment` 

The deployment ID

#### `hasIndexingErrors` 

If `true`, the subgraph encountered indexing errors at some past block
