title: Thank You

The Tribute DAO Framework was conceived based on the solid and foundational work done by our team, [MolochVentures](https://moloch.vc/), and [Meta Cartel](https://www.metacartel.org/) in [MolochV2](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch). This framework extends the [MolochV2](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch) contracts to create a DAO framework with new features and modularity in mind. It was only possible to design, and implement such a solution because great precursors have opened the path forward with the release of [MolochV2](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch).

Because of that, we want to say **THANK YOU** to **all** coders, designers, auditors, and any individual who have contributed with ideas, resources, and energy to this and previous versions of this project. Thanks for helping to shape the DAO open source ecosystem, and a special thank you to [MolochV2](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch) creators/contributors:
